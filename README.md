# Persistence Testbed: Labview Interface #

**This repository contains a LabView VI for acquiring data from the LRAUV testbed.**

## Overview ##
The Persistence Testbed will be used to develop advanced AUV health monitoring algorithms. It consists of a benchtop-mounted frame containing most of the Tethys AUV actuators, a Labview interface to collect actuator performance data, and a Python interface to control the actuators and the data acquisition. The ultimate objective is to collect data on all actuators.

## Mass shifter ##
Data acquisition on the mass-shifter (aka pitch-pack) is complete. Figure 1 shows the layout:

* The mass-shifter consists of a large mass attached to a lead screw driven by a motor. The motorâ€™s commanded position is sent by Python to the motor controller, and actuator performance is measured by five (external) sensors: an absolute mass position string potentiometer, a high-rate motor current sensor, a high-rate motor voltage sensor, and 2 piezo-accelerometers. Data is acquired by three National Instrument DAQs.

* Additionally, sensor data generated by the tested's (internal) sensors is also collected: motor encoder count, load-control board voltage, and load-control board current are read by the main vehicle computer. This data is generated at a rate of order 1Hz.

* A Labview VI running on a Windows laptop is used  to acquire/display/log the data. The interface with Python is done over ZMQ.

## Thruster ##
Data acquisition on the thruster is underway. Figure 2 shows the layout:
